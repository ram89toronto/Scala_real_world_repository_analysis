# Scala Repository Analysis

##Questions

- Is there camaraderie in the project ?
- What files were changed in the last ten pull requests?
- Who made the most pull requests to a given file ?

# Data Source 
The dataset we used, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:
1.pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.
2. pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.
3.pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.
